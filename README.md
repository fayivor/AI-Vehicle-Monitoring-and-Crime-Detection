# AI Vehicle Monitoring & Crime Detection System

## NDA Notice

**Due to NDA restrictions, this repository contains a simplified version that reflects the techniques and thought processes used in my real-world work.** It showcases the implementation of a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline system designed for vehicle monitoring and crime detection applications. The project demonstrates advanced AI integration including:

- **Hybrid RAG Architecture**: Combining FAISS vector similarity search with rank-based filtering for optimal information retrieval
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Dynamic context shaping based on user roles and threat levels
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-2-second response times with graceful degradation under load
- **Security-First Design**: Role-based access control, data encryption, and comprehensive audit logging
- **Production-Ready Deployment**: Docker containerization, AWS EC2 deployment scripts, and monitoring integration

This implementation showcases enterprise-level software architecture, security considerations, and performance optimization techniques used in government and high-security environments.
