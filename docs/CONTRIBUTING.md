## Security Protocols

### Development Environment Security

1. **Secure Development Environment**: Use only government-approved and secured development machines
2. **Encrypted Storage**: All code and data must be stored on encrypted drives
3. **Network Security**: Development must occur on secured government networks only
4. **Access Logging**: All development activities are logged and monitored
5. **Code Review**: All changes require security review before implementation

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Security Clearance**: Valid government security clearance
- **Approved Hardware**: Government-issued or approved development machine
- **Secure Network**: Access to Ghana government secure development network
- **Software Requirements**:
  - Python 3.9 or higher
  - Docker and Docker Compose
  - Git with government-approved configuration
  - Government-approved IDE/editor

### Getting Started

**Note**: These steps must be performed on a secured government development environment.

1. **Verify Security Clearance**
   ```bash
   # Verify your clearance status with IT Security Division
   # Obtain development environment approval
   ```

2. **Clone the repository** (Authorized personnel only)
   ```bash
   git clone <classified-repository-url>
   cd ai-vehicle-system
   ```

3. **Setup development environment**
   ```bash
   make setup-dev
   ```

4. **Configure environment** (Use classified configuration)
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with classified configuration parameters
   # Contact IT Security for production keys and credentials
   ```

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Standards

We maintain high code quality standards:

- **Type hints** for all Python functions
- **Comprehensive unit test coverage** (>80%)
- **Integration tests** for RAG pipeline
- **Performance benchmarking** for each feature
- **Code review** requirements for all changes

### Before Submitting

Run all quality checks:

```bash
make check-all
```

This will run:
- Linting (flake8, black, isort)
- Type checking (mypy)
- Tests with coverage
- Security checks

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test changes
- `chore`: Build/tooling changes

### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

## Architecture Guidelines

### RAG Pipeline Implementation

Follow the hybrid RAG architecture:

```
Input → Vector Similarity (FAISS) → Rank-Based Filtering → Context Assembly → LLM Processing → Output
```

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Implement context shaping based on user roles:

- **Officers**: Focus on immediate actionable intel
- **Analysts**: Provide detailed historical patterns
- **Administrators**: Include system metrics and summaries

### Security Requirements

- Encrypt all vehicle and personal data
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Maintain comprehensive audit logs
- Follow Ghana data protection regulations

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
2. **Integration Tests**: RAG pipeline end-to-end
3. **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
4. **Security Tests**: Penetration and vulnerability testing
5. **User Acceptance Tests**: Role-based functionality testing

### Writing Tests

```python
import pytest
from src.models.vehicle import Vehicle

def test_vehicle_creation():
    """Test vehicle model creation."""
    vehicle = Vehicle(
        vehicle_id="VH-001-2024",
        registration_number="GH-1234-24",
        owner_details={
            "name": "John Doe",
            "id_number": "GHA123456789"
        }
    )
    assert vehicle.vehicle_id == "VH-001-2024"
    assert vehicle.status == "active"
```

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time Targets

- Vector similarity search: < 100ms
- Full RAG pipeline: < 2 seconds
- Real-time context updates: < 500ms
- System availability: 99.5% uptime

### Scalability Requirements

- Support 1000+ concurrent users
- Handle 10K+ vehicle records efficiently
- Process 1K+ incident reports daily
- Maintain sub-second query response times

## Documentation

### API Documentation

Use OpenAPI/Swagger annotations:

```python
@router.get("/vehicles/{vehicle_id}", response_model=Vehicle)
async def get_vehicle(
    vehicle_id: str = Path(..., description="Vehicle identifier"),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
) -> Vehicle:
    """
    Get a specific vehicle by ID.
    
    Args:
        vehicle_id: Vehicle identifier
        current_user: Current authenticated user
        
    Returns:
        Vehicle information
        
    Raises:
        HTTPException: If vehicle not found
    """
```

### Code Documentation

- Document all public functions and classes
- Include type hints
- Provide examples for complex functions
- Explain business logic and algorithms

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- Never log sensitive data (passwords, personal info)
- Use encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper access controls
- Follow Ghana data protection laws

### Authentication & Authorization

- Use JWT tokens for authentication
- Implement role-based permissions
- Log all access attempts
- Secure API endpoints

## Deployment

### Environment Configuration

- Use environment variables for configuration
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use different configs for dev/staging/prod
- Document all configuration options

### Docker Best Practices

- Use multi-stage builds
- Run as non-root user
- Minimize image size
- Include health checks

## Getting Help

- Check existing issues and documentation
- Ask questions in discussions
- Follow the code of conduct
- Be respectful and constructive
